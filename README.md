#Functional Programming Principles in Scala

These are my solutions to the [first Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) on Coursera. The course is taught by Martin Odersky - the designer of Scala - and is an intro to the language in a functional format with a focus on testing and good programming style. Here's a link to my [course certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/Z9HCN9VZQED7)

I first got interested in Scala through the [Spark API](http://spark.apache.org) and it's ease of use for processing data too large to fit on one machine. I soon got intrigued by the beauty of its functional aspects and am using this course as a jumping off point to learning more about the ins and outs of the language and functional programming as a whole.
