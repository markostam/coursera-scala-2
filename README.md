#Functional Program Design in Scala

These are my solutions to the [second Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2) on Coursera, "Functional Program Design in Scala". The course is taught by Martin Odersky - the designer of Scala - and is based on the Scala FP course taught at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch). 

For more, check out my [notes and solutions](https://github.com/markostam/coursera-scala-1) to the the first course in the Scala FP specialization "Functional Programming Principles in Scala".
